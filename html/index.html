    <h1>Ham Radio Practice Exams</h1>
    <h2>Q&A:</h2>
    <h3>What is ham radio?</h3>
    <p>Ham radio (also known as amateur radio) is a licensed radio service dedicated to experimenting with equipment and helping others.</p>
    <h3>Why should I get a ham radio license?</h3>
    <p>With a ham radio license, you will be allowed to build new equipment from scratch, test the communication range of various equipment, and volunteer for the community (from local event volunteering such as marathons and parades to natural
      disaster preparedness).</p>
    <h3>Why are there three different exams?</h3>
    <p>The ham radio license comes in three different tiers (each build on top of each other). The technician class license allows people to communicate around town. The general class license allows people to talk around the world using shortwave
      radio. Finally, the extra class license offers a few extra shortwave priviliges plus a few extra perks (such as a shorter callsign and the ability to proctor ham radio exams).</p>
